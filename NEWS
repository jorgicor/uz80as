	* Added DS directive (just another name for the BLOCK directive). It
	  existed in TASM but not in the official documentation. Thank you
	  Nathan Poysti to point this out.

	* Allow trailing commas (in DB and DW lists, for example).

	* Added > operator to force 6502 16 bit addresses when a zero page is
	  used, following the same syntax of the mc6800 target.

1.11	2020-03-29

	* Fixed an important bug with unary operators and nested expressions.
          For instance, ~(1|2) resulted in 0xFE generated (it was parsed as
          if ~1|2), instead of the correct 0xFC (~3).
          Thank you very much to Curt Meyer (https://github.com/cm68) for
          the bug report and providing a simple and clever fix.
	  This was a severe bug that didn't show with any of my tests.

	Source changes
	--------------

	* expr.c: Fixed the expression parser and multiplied the stack size
          by 3 since we now always push 3 elements, to avoid overflow.

	* Added a new test 'unary' for testing unary operators with nested
          expressions.

	* Added THANKS file.

1.10	2018-10-14

	* Changed project site to https://jorgicor.niobe.org/uz80as .

1.09	2018-09-29

	* New target added: Motorola 68HC11.
	* Fixes tests for 6800 and 6801.
	* The instructions in the documentation for each target now are listed
          in alphabetical order.

1.08	2018-09-23

	* New targets added:
	  - Intel 8021, 8022, 8041, 8048, 8051.
	  - Motorola 6800, 6801.

	Source changes
	--------------

	* Changed the substitution algorithm of print_inst(). Now it allows for
	  multiple digits after a character code (permits e16 in tables).
	  Duplicating @ if found. Changed targets' tables accordingly.

1.07	2018-09-15

	* New targets added:
	  - i4004: Intel 4004.
	  - i4040: Intel 4040. 

	Source changes
	--------------

	* Fixed mreg(). If we had a word list like { LD, LDD, ... } and we
	  tried to parse LDD, only LD was matched. Now, if we match a word
	  but what comes next is alphanumeric, we discard the match and
	  resume with the rest of words in the list.

	* Changed the substitution algorithm of print_inst(). Now it requires
	  two characters for each 'a' substitution. Changed targets' tables
	  accordingly.

	* Changed instruction syntax in the manual when referring to
	  expressions.

1.06	2018-09-09

	* 6500 family added:
	  - mos6502: MOS Technology 6502.
	  - r6501: Rockwell R6501.
	  - g65sc02: California Micro Devices G65SC02.
	  - r65c02: Rockwell R65C02.
	  - r65c29: Rockwell R65C29.
	  - w65c02s: Western Design Center W65C02S.

	* Fixed some instructions for the i8080 and i8085 (ADI, ACI, SUI, SBI,
	  ANI, XRI, ORI, CPI, IN, OUT).

1.05	2018-07-22

	* New targets added:
	  - hd64180: Hitachi HD64180.
	  - dp2200: Datapoint 2200 version I.
	  - dp2200ii: Datapoint 2200 version II.
	  - i8008: Intel 8008.
	  - i8085: Intel 8085.

	* Changes to facilitate the addition of a new target that merely
	  extends another.

1.04	2018-07-15

	* uz80as becomes a multitarget assembler. The default target is the
	  Zilog Z80. Other targets can be selected using the `--target` command
	  line option.

	* The targets accepted are:
	  - z80: Zilog Z80 (the default if no target specified).
	  - i8080: Intel 8080.
	  - gbcpu: Sharp LR35902 (Nintendo Gameboy CPU).

	* Added the `--undocumented` command line option to enable undocumented
	  instructions.

	* Added a `--license` command line option.

	* Fixed: for the Z80, the `OUT (C),0` and SLL instructions where
	  accepted by default, but they are undocumented instructions. Now are
	  only accepted with the `--undocumented` command line option.

1.03	2017-04-04

	* Fixed typo in the --help output (assemle to assemble).

	* Separating a long command line option from its argument using '=' now
	  is accepted, for example, `--define="MUL(a,b) (a*b)"`.

	* The CHANGELOG.md file is now called NEWS.

1.02	2016-09-02

	* Fixed: the object and listing files, when they were not specified
	  on the command line, were generated in the same directory of the
	  source. Now they are generated in the current working directory.

	Source changes
	--------------

	* main.c (mkfname): changed to remove the path from the source
	  filename.

	* Prepared for VPATH builds. Changed all tests to allow this.

1.01	2016-08-10

	Source changes
	--------------

	* The configure script and Makefiles are generated from autoconf 2.69
	  and automake 1.15.

	* Including mkwin script to build on Windows.

1.00	2016-06-05

	* Initial release.
